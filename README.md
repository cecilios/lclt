# Lomse command-line tool (lclt)


lclt, an acronym for "Lomse Command-Line Tool", is mainly an interface with the Lomse library and was started as a tool for automating regression tests of the Lomse library. It should evolve to be a toolkit for manipulating music scores from the command line, to create, edit, or convert them to images or other music score formats. But I have no time for developing this, so its main purpose is as a tool for Lomse vissual regression tests.
